<p>The Addon VAR Archive is a Git Archive designed to assist VARS in upgrading their independently developed Addon modules by bringing over any changes that may have occurred in code that is shared between the module and Addon's core code.<br> 
For example, if you have developed a module against Addon 8.31 and wish to upgrade to the current Addon 14.00 and your module incorporates several of our programs and callpoints, you can either try to perform a time-consuming and error-prone diff comparison between the Addon code you think you incorporated in 8.31 and the Addon code in 14.00 or you can let Git do the job for you, and upgrade your code, while informing you in the form of conflicts about places that both you and we have changed the code. This process generally results in less work on your part -- especially after the initial upgrade using the Git archive -- and greater accuracy in code changes. 
To learn more about this process, please see the following documentation:<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-1alrNFGq2Zpo8WoDhOmG-3S8xr25bMee65PKWe04Ys/edit?usp=sharing">Using the Addon VAR Archive</a></p>

			<ul>
            <li>New for version 18.00
            <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>General</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implemented previous structural changes in Addon Company and Report Control files so logos for documents such as Invoices, Statements, and Purchase Orders can now use a document-specific logo, a firm-specific logo, or the default logo specified in the config file.</li>
                        <li>Added Import Recipients additional option to the Report Control Recipients form to facilitate a bulk import of customers and/or vendors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Accounting</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implemented previous structural changes to allow 1024-character comments in the AP Invoice Header, Vendor Master, Cash Receipts Header/Detail/GL Distribution, Simple Invoice Header, Customer Master, and GL Account Master. In some cases the new comment replaces legacy 80-character comment lines, and in others new comment fields have been added. See the <a href="http://www.basis.com/readme-bbj" target="_blank">readme</a> for the detailed list of files.</li>
                        <li>Added historical inquiry forms for AP Invoices, Cash Receipts, and Simple Invoices.</li>
                        <li>New Salesperson Call List report generates a list of customers with overdue balances to use as a guide for salesperson calls.</li>
                        <li>Bank Reconciliation allows a Current Statement Date in a locked period, as long as the date is in the prior, current, or next fiscal year.</li>
                        <li>Bank Reconciliation Check Detail and Other Transaction grids allow multiple selections, and include a context menu to quickly change the Code on the selected rows.</li>
                        <li>The number of prior years listed in the GL Account Summary Activity grid and the GL Budget Maintenance gird is now configurable, rather than being limited to 5 years.</li>
                        <li>The AR Aging Analysis Report and the Customer Name & Address Listing can now be generated in a format suitable for loading into a spreadsheet.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Distribution</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added a new option to Order Entry to automatically generate a Work Order for an item that has a Bill of Materials, and for which the quantity currently available is less than the order ship quantity.</li>
                        <li>Implemented previous structural changes to allow 1024-character comments in the Order/Invoice Header and Detail (detail comments print on Pick Lists and Invoices), OP Standard Messages, Purchase Requisition Detail, Purchase Order Detail, Purchase Order Receipt Detail, Purchase Order Invoice Detail (detail comments print on Purchase Orders), and PO Standard Messages. In some cases the new comment replaces legacy 80-character comment lines, and in others new comment fields have been added. See the <a href="http://www.basis.com/readme-bbj" target="_blank">readme</a> for the detailed list of files.</li>
                        <li>Added historical inquiry form for Purchase Receipts.</li>

                        <li>Reformatted the Monthly Sales Report into columnar output consistent with the Export Format option available on several other reports.</li>
                        <li>Purchase Order Invoice Entry defaults the receiver to the first un-billed receiver for the entered PO.</li>
                        <li>Added the Credit Maintenance form as an additional option from the Customer Master form.</li>
                        <li>Allow selling selected items in Order Processing by either their normal Unit of Sale, or by their normal Unit of Purchase.</li>
                        <li>The OP Shipping Schedule Report, the OP Order Status Report By Customer, and the OP Open Order Detail Report can now be generated in a format suitable for loading into a spreadsheet.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Manufacturing</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added "Date Effective After" and "Date Obsolete Before" filters to the Bill of Materials Operations Where Used report.</li>

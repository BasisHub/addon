			Version 14.01 takes advantage of the technological advancements provided by Barista&reg; and BBj&reg; to deliver an innovative software package known for its structural quality. Together with Barista, AddonSoftware offers a leap forward in the efficiency of software customization and the creation of vertical applications. AddonSoftware
continues its 25-year history of constant improvement - additional features, increased functionality, and updated technology - in this release.
			<ul>
			<li>New for version 14.00
			<br />
				<ul>
                    <li>A new Addon Dashboard has been added. It leverages  BBj's new Dashboard utility to provide a starter set of real-time data widgets for visualizing Addon data. The set is designed to provide examples of tool functionality for sales demonstrations, future Addon features, and VAR enhancements. Included in the set are widgets displaying General Ledger and Sales data.</li>
					<li>The AIUW has been enhanced with an option to do a "Quick Copy" of Addon from bbj_home to a different parent directory. The utility copies both the Barista Application Framework and AddonSoftware, automatically includes demo data, and only requires a brief synchronization. The Quick Copy is ideal for demonstrations or training.</li>
					<li>The Addon Jasper reports now offer one-click saving in .pdf format, as well as an email button to launch the Barista fax/email form, so you can add Jasper-based .pdf documents to the Document Processing Queue. Jasper documents saved as .pdf are also now recorded in the Barista document archive, so they can be recalled from Document Inquiry.</li>
					<li>Accounting</li>
                    <ul><li>Accounts Payable module has been enhanced with a new Payment Authorization feature allowing remote authorization and e-signatures. This optional feature includes parameters to establish number of required signatures based on check amount, location where scanned documents are stored, colors to indicate invoice payment status in Payment selection, and optional warning on Invoice Register for missing required images.  </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Distribution</li>
                    <ul><li>Sales Analysis reports now include the new "Export format" option which formats the documents for exporting to Excel.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Manufacturing</li>
                    <ul><li>The Work Order processing flow has been enhanced with a new "Op Ref" field for more user-friendly operations cross-referencing and efficient time sheet entry. Enhanced tasks include the three Work Order Entry Requirements tasks, the WO batch and on-demand Detail reports, the Traveler report, and the three Time Sheet Entry tasks.</li>
					<li>The Operations, Materials, and Subcontracts standards SPROCs of the Work Order Detail and Traveler reports have been enhanced to provide VARs with test pattern printing to streamline Jasper modification.</li>
					<li>The Work Order Detail and Traveler reports have been re-designed for efficiency, producing more compact output, while maintaining readability by adding a "green bar" effect.</li>
					<li>The Shop Floor Materials and Subcontracts files contain a new alpha-numeric reference number field that gives the user more control and flexibility when correlating materials and subcontracts to drawings. When processing materials, there is also a new "auto-number" function that lets the user specify the beginning and ending row to auto-number, the first number to use, and an increment, making it possible to quickly and easily auto-number (or re-number) an entire list of materials, or subsets of the list.</li>
					<li>Bill of Materials now include a new alpha-numeric reference number field that mirrors Shop Floor's refernece number field in Operations, Materials, and Subcontracts.</li>
					<li>Work Order Material Commitments and Issues has been enhanced with a new reference number field. </li>
                    </ul>

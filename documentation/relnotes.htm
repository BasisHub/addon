			Version 16.20 takes advantage of the technological advancements provided by Barista&reg; and BBj&reg; to deliver an innovative software package known for its structural quality. Together with Barista, AddonSoftware offers a leap forward in the efficiency of software customization and the creation of vertical applications. AddonSoftware
continues its 25-year history of constant improvement - additional features, increased functionality, and updated technology - in this release.
			<ul>
            <li>Preview for version 17.00</li>
                <ul>
                     <li>Increased zoom and set 'fit to width' to improve readability in the Report Viewer.</li>
                     <li>Creation of embedded widgets is now managed by Barista so the connection string is not exposed in AddonSoftware code.</li>
                     <li>The Digital Dashboard's GL Income Account Totals grid widget incorporates a new BBj dashboard method to size column widths based on the contents of the column headings and the first few rows of data.</li>
                     <li>Custom Inventory Item lookup has been enhanced to include a small image of the item selected in the lookup grid.</li>
                     <li>A new license agreement form is presented when you launch Addon, giving the end user (not just the VAR/installer) a chance to read and accept the agreement.</li>
                     <li>The new license agreement form has been enhanced to include OK/Cancel buttons for more intuitive operation. The form will continue to appear with each launch until the user selects the Accept option and clicks OK.</li>

			Version 17.12 takes advantage of the technological advancements provided by Barista&reg; and BBj&reg; to deliver an innovative software package known for its structural quality. Together with Barista, AddonSoftware offers a leap forward in the efficiency of software customization and the creation of vertical applications. AddonSoftware
continues its history of constant improvement - additional features, increased functionality, and updated technology - in this release.
			<ul>
            <li>Preview for version 18.00
            <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>General</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implemented previous structural changes in Addon Company and Report Control files so logos for documents such as Invoices, Statements, and Purchase Orders can now use a document-specific logo, a firm-specific logo, or the default logo specified in the config file.</li>
                        <li>Added Import Recipients additional option to the Report Control Recipients form to facilitate a bulk import of customers and/or vendors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Accounting</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implemented previous structural changes to allow 1024-character comments in the AP Invoice Header, Vendor Master, Cash Receipts Header/Detail/GL Distribution, Simple Invoice Header, Customer Master, and GL Account Master. In some cases the new comment replaces legacy 80-character comment lines, and in others new comment fields have been added. See the <a href="http://www.basis.com/readme-bbj" target="_blank">readme</a> for the detailed list of files.</li>
                        <li>Added historical inquiry forms for AP Invoices, Cash Receipts, and Simple Invoices.</li>
                        <li>New Salesperson Call List report generates a list of customers with overdue balances to use as a guide for salesperson calls.</li>
                        <li>Bank Reconciliation allows a Current Statement Date in a locked period, as long as the date is in the prior, current, or next fiscal year.</li>
                        <li>Bank Reconciliation Check Detail and Other Transaction grids allow multiple selections, and include a context menu to quickly change the Code on the selected rows.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Distribution</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added a new option to Order Entry to automatically generate a Work Order for an item that has a Bill of Materials, and for which the quantity currently available is less than the order ship quantity.</li>
                        <li>Implemented previous structural changes to allow 1024-character comments in the Order/Invoice Header and Detail (detail comments print on Pick Lists and Invoices), OP Standard Messages, Purchase Requisition Detail, Purchase Order Detail, Purchase Order Receipt Detail, Purchase Order Invoice Detail (detail comments print on Purchase Orders), and PO Standard Messages. In some cases the new comment replaces legacy 80-character comment lines, and in others new comment fields have been added. See the <a href="http://www.basis.com/readme-bbj" target="_blank">readme</a> for the detailed list of files.</li>
                        <li>Added historical inquiry form for Purchase Receipts.</li>
                        <li>Enhanced Invoice History Inquiry to allow view/edit of header-level comments, and view of detail comments.</li>
                        <li>Added default Beginning and Ending Dates to the Sales Tax Report.</li>
                        <li>Reformatted the Monthly Sales Report into columnar output consistent with the Export Format option available on several other reports.</li>
                        <li>Purchase Order Invoice Entry defaults the receiver to the first un-billed receiver for the entered PO.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Manufacturing</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added "Date Effective After" and "Date Obsolete Before" filters to the Bill of Materials Operations Where Used report.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>New for version 17.00
            <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>General</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Barista enhancements to Expresso bring a suite of new queries to replace and improve on legacy Addon's SpeedSearch application. </li>
                        <li>New MDI backgrounds can be displayed for each company given Barista enhancements to the Firms table. </li>
                        <li>Enhanced Expresso lookups for Customer, Item, and Vendor are now used throughout the application. </li>
                        <li>Increased zoom and set 'fit to width' improve readability in the Report Viewer. </li>
                        <li>Creation of embedded widgets is now managed by Barista for better security. </li>
                        <li>The Digital Dashboard's GL Income Account Totals grid widget incorporates a new BBj dashboard method to size column widths based on the contents of the column headings and the first few rows of data. </li>
                        <li>A new license agreement form is presented when you launch Addon, giving the end user (not just the VAR/installer) a chance to read and accept the agreement. The form will continue to appear with each launch until the user selects the Accept option and clicks OK. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Accounting</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each fiscal year now has it's own separate fiscal calendar rather than sharing a single fiscal calendar for all fiscal years. This better accommodates companies with fiscal calendars that vary from year to year. </li>
                        <li>General Ledger Account Summary information is now retained for all fiscal years instead of for just the current, prior and next fiscal years. </li>
                        <li>A new "inactive" field has been added to the Customer, Vendor, and GL Account master tables. The associated queries have pre-defined filters to view active or all records. Related reports include an option to suppress reporting inactive records. Attempting to use an inactive customer, vendor, or GL Account results in a warning, and may be prevented in some instances if appropriate. Marking a particular record as inactive does not alter data already in the system. </li>
                        <li>The GL Journal Update now writes to the Bank Rec Other table when Bank Rec is installed and the update processes an entry that matches one of the listed Bank Accounts, doing away with the need to enter these transactions twice. </li>
                        <li>Added password override to GL Update Beginning Balances task that allows updating current year beginning balance even though the prior year is closed. </li>
                        <li>Accounts Payable Export 1099 Data to Text has been updated for 2016 export to Account Ability. </li>
                        <li>The Accounts Payable check format (Check/Stub/Stub, Stub/Check/Stub, etc.) is now stored in the parameters and appears as the default on the Check Print form. </li>
                        <li>The GL Transaction History report has a new filter to report only the postings for a specific audit number. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Distribution</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A new "inactive" field has been added to the Inventory Item master table. The associated query has a pre-defined filter to view active or all items. Related reports include an option to suppress reporting inactive items. Attempting to use an inactive item results in a warning, and may be prevented in some instances if appropriate. Marking an item as inactive does not alter data already in the system. </li>
                        <li>Enhanced Sales Analysis forms carry embedded bar charts to provide a visual representation of the sales, cost, and units.
                        <li>Combined credit status and credit hold/release messages to provide more information in OP Order Entry and Invoice Entry. </li>
                        <li>Custom Inventory Item lookup has been enhanced to include a small image of the item selected in the lookup grid. </li>
                        <li>Users can now enter Beginning and Ending Receipt Dates for the PO Receipt History By Item report so it can be filtered by date. </li>
                        <li>You can now look up an historical invoice using just the invoice number, rather than needing both invoice and customer numbers. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Manufacturing</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bills of Material are tied to Items so if an Item is marked inactive, the corresponding Bill is inactive as well. </li>
                        <li>Load Balance Inquiry now uses an embedded bar chart widget for enhanced functionality. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Testing</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This version passes all QF-Test suites.</li>
                    </ul>

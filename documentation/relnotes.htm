                    <li>Addon Dashboard</li>
                        <ul><li>The GL Income Comparison widget now has drilldown capability. Click on a period revenue column, and the chart changes to show the revenue for that period by account. Then click on an account column to drill further and see a grid showing the transactions for the account for the period.</li>
                        <li>New widget in the Accounting category provides Company level aging with drilldown to show top customers for the selected aging category.</li>
                        <li>New Manufacturing tab with a widget that shows Work Orders linked to Sales Orders; includes filters for both Work Order status and Sales Order Status.</li>
                        <li>The Top Salesreps widgets have new drilldowns that present a grid detailing YTD and Prior Year Sales by Product Type.</li>
                        <li>Fast access to the dashboard via a new top-level menu.</li>
                        <li>Optimized SPROCs and new Sales Analysis totals tables improve load/display times for Sales Analysis data.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <li>Report Control
                        <ul><li>New fields in the Report Control Document table allow association of Barista Email Account with individual documents, as well as default From, Reply-to, Subject and Message to streamline entry of Report Control Recipient records.</li>
                        <li>Customer and Vendor Report Control tables consolidated into single, Report Control Recipients table. New table also accommodates "other" type recipient for stand-alone reports.</li>
                        <li>New Report Control custom object makes it easy to fax/email enable documents.</li> 
                        </ul>
					<li>Accounting</li>
                    <ul><li>Embedded dashboard widget on Customer Master form shows customer's aged balance, dynamically switching from a pie chart to a bar chart to show credit balances.</li>
                    <li>SPROC code optimizations boost the speed of the AR Drilldown Sales Report.</li>
                    <li>AR Statements and Simple Invoices are enhanced, so in addition to the current Master copy showing all statements/invoices in the batch run, there is also now a Print copy containing only those documents that need to be printed. Closing the Master copy prompts the user to forward designated documents to the document queue, ensuring that documents don't go into the queue without approval.</li>
                    <li>When generating a statement from within the Customer form, the 'Send via Report Control' checkbox will only be enabled if the customer has a report control record specifying email or fax transmission. In addition, closing the statement viewer will prompt the user to forward the statement to the document queue, ensuring that documents don't go into the queue without approval.</li>
                    <li>The Balance and Sales drilldowns on the Customer Master have been improved to include both OP and AR invoices, with hyperlinks on the invoice number to launch either OP Historical Invoice Inquiry, or Barista's Document Inquiry, filtered on the AR Invoice Number. New fields showing the last aging criteria for this customer have been added to the Customer form, along with drilldowns for each aged balance field. The new drilldowns make use of the aging criteria to show the invoices associated with each aging bucket.</li>
                    <li>The AR Invoice header file now contains a balance field, so tasks no longer need to read through all of the invoice detail in order to separate zero balance from unpaid invoices.</li>
                    <li>Accounts Payable Export 1099 Data to Text has been updated for 2014 export to Account Ability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Distribution</li>
                    <ul><li>Realtime Processing in OP; Order/Invoice Entry have undergone a revision to eliminate the two-step process of entering data into one set of files, then transferring the data to the transaction history files after the register/update. All records are now written directly to the transaction history files, using new fields that carry the record status and creation/modification stamps to direct data entry, registers, updates, and queries. New Custom query leverages the structural modifications, and allows users to query on open orders only, open orders and invoices, or all orders and invoices.</li>
                    <li>New custom query improves performance when creating a Duplicate or Credit Memo in Order/Invoice Entry. Hyperlinks in the query grid let the user launch a secondary query on invoice detail, or launch the Invoice History Inquiry form.</li>                    
                    <li>Invoicing has been enhanced so that, in addition to the current Master copy showing all invoices in the batch run, there is also now a Print copy containing only those invoices that need to be printed. The Print Now button in Invoice Entry launches a new form so the user can specify a message for the on-demand invoice, as well as select whether or not to process the invoice according to report control settings. Both batch (Master) and on-demand invoices will prompt the user to update the print file. Only when the user chooses to do the update are print flags set and applicable invoices added to the document processing queue, ensuring that documents don't go into the queue without approval.</li>
                    <li>The Historical Invoice is now a Jasper report, giving it the same format as regular invoices, and also providing email capability.</li>
                    <li>Added product type and related index to IV Warehouse Master table to improve performance on the Stock Status Report.</li>
                    </ul>

The utility runs automatically when launching Addon after an upgrade, ensuring the proper post-upgrade conversions are accomplished before running the application.</li>

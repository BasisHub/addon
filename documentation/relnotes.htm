			Version 19.00 takes advantage of the technological advancements provided by Barista&reg; and BBj&reg; to deliver an innovative software package known for its structural quality. Together with Barista, AddonSoftware offers a leap forward in the efficiency of software customization and the creation of vertical applications. AddonSoftware
continues its history of constant improvement - additional features, increased functionality, and updated technology - in this release.
			<ul>
            <li>New for version 19.00
            <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Accounting</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AP Check Printing now generates separate ACH non-negotiable checks for vendors setup to receive ACH payments. The AP Check Register update generates a text file with all necessary NACHA information for the financial institution to process ACH payments for all ACH non-negotiable checks.</li>
                        <li>The user interface for Payment Selection Entry has been enhanced for more intuitive operation in both "standard" and "Payment Authorization" modes. Other enhancements include a new invoice number filter, the ability to undo an invoice review or approval, a file chooser and image display for the check approver's signature file, and the option to save scanned invoices to the Barista Document Archive.</li>
                        <li>Credit card payments can be accepted and automatically entered into Cash Receipts via a new option on the Customer form. Accept credit cards from several gateways using either an internal API or hosted payment page. Responses from gateways are saved for historical inquiry, and are also accessible from the Customer form.</li>
                        <li>Added "Discount Date (S)" option to the "Age By" listbutton for the AP Cash Requirements Report and the AP Aging Report.</li>
                        <li>Added country ID to vendors' purchasing address table as well as AP checks.</li>
                        <li>Added company fax number to AP and AR Report Parameters. Company's fax number printed next to logo on customer Statements and AR Simple Invoices.</li>
                        <li>Added option the Monthly Check Report and the Disbursement Journal to allow printing the reports without breaking on AP Type.</li>
                        <li>Enhanced the 1099 export to let user choose the output directory, and added the current 1099 year to the filename.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Distribution</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users can now create a new Purchase Order from within Purchase Order Entry by duplicating a historical receipt.</li>
                        <li>A new carrier data exchange subsystem maintains third party shipping ID's and facilitates interfacing to shipment tracking software. The Ship Via code is now file verified, and the Customer and Ship-to records now contain the third party ID and email address. The third party shipping ID prints on the Pick List, and package tracking numbers are included on the Invoice. A new Shipment Tracking table allows manual entry of tracking numbers, weight, freight cost, etc., or can be populated automatically if a third party interface is implemented. The shipping cost is automatically used for the Invoice freight amount.</li>
                        <li>Custom user defined masks are now allowed for inventory Item IDs, the same as for Customer IDs and Vendor IDs.</li>
                        <li>Added vendor's country and purchasing address country to Purchase Orders and Requisitions, and PO Receipt and Invoice Entry.</li>
                        <li>Company's fax number now prints next to logo on OP Picking Lists, Invoices and Historical Invoices, and on PO Purchase Orders and Requisitions.</li>
                        <li>The Cash Sale form now contains a "card last 4" field for use in credit card sales, and no longer permits entry of a full credit card number. The Sales Register and OP Invoice print only the new card last 4 field. In addition, the v19 Conversion Utility now scrubs any credit card numbers coming from a V6 or pre-v19 Barista/Addon database, preserving only the last 4 digits.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>General</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enhanced Addon's Install Wizard to create a new installation with either no data, or with default parameters and codes.</li>
                        <li>Enhanced Addon's Setup New Firm utility to create a new firm with either no data, or with default parameters and codes.</li>
                        <li>Enhanced Addon's Copy Data From Firm To Firm utility to allow excluding transaction files.</li>
                        <li>Enhanced queries in Expresso to add hyperlinked ellipsis ("...") column so users can launch Barista's comment dialog window when querying a table that contains a memo_1024 comment field.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Testing</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This version passes all QF-Test suites.</li>
                    </ul>

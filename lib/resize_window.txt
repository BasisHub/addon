resize_window.txt - Instructions for using the resize_window routine
====================================================================

What's it for?
--------------

You use the resize_window routine when you are adding controls to Barista and
you want the form (window) to be the correct size.  If you don't resize the 
window, the user may not know your new controls exists; they may be obscured by
the window size.


How do I use it?
----------------

resize_window.src is designed to be copied and pasted into the <CUSTOM> area of
your callpoint code, but it can be put anywhere a subroutine makes sense.  You
should call it immediately after setting up the last control.

	gosub format_grid
	gosub resize_window

	
Why can't I see the buttons?
----------------------------

resize_window has one limitation: it needs to be called in the After Window
Create (AWIN) event in order for the push buttons to display correctly.  This 
is probably because between AWIN and BSHO (Before Show) Barista sets up where 
the button are.  If you resize in AWIN, Barista will take care of positioning 
the buttons for you.


Did resize_window change the window position?
---------------------------------------------

Maybe.  It's designed to move the window if the new dimensions will not fit in
the current screen.  Otherwise it leaves the positioning of the window up to
Barista


What if I like my form size bigger than the controls?
-----------------------------------------------------

That's okay.  resize_window will never make your form smaller, only bigger, and
only enough to fit all the controls.

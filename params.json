This process generally results in less work on your part -- especially after the initial upgrade using the Git archive -- and greater accuracy in code changes. \r\nTo learn more about this process, please see the following documentation:<br> \r\n[Using the Addon VAR Archive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-1alrNFGq2Zpo8WoDhOmG-3S8xr25bMee65PKWe04Ys/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### How do I get access to this archive?^\r\n1.
